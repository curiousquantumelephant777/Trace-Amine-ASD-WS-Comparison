# Trace-Amine-ASD-WS-Comparison
This research proposes a novel metabolic framework for understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Williams Syndrome (WS) not as "deficits," but as distinct Endogenous Psychedelic States. I hypothesize that the phenotypic "mirroring" observed between these conditions (social withdrawal and sensory intensity in ASD versus hypersociability and social fearlessness in WS) is driven by divergent shunts in the pineal and trace amine pathways. Specifically, this model proposes that ASD is driven by an overactive INMT/DMT/bufotenin pathway (leading to continual sensory overload), whereas WS is characterized by an overactive PEA/TAAR1 pathway (possibly involving novel endogenous substituted phenethylamines), which drives the hypersociability.
